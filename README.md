**Problem Statement**

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting finding.

**Project Summary**


THE Netflix movies and TV shows clustering is a project where we shall draw insights from our data and will clusterr our dataset into relevant cluster. We shall start by first knowing our data but before that we need to import important libraries.Once done we shall now start by mounting our drive and then loading our dataset.

Once we have our dataset we shall go through shape and various columns to know what all our dataset contains* and what each column represent. We shall also go through description of column made available to us to know our dataset better.We have 7787 rows and 12 columns.

Now we shall move further to clean our dataset. To clean dataset we shall start by finding if there are any duplicate. But there are none so now we shall find if there are any null value.Since our dataset contains null set we shall drop some colum and for some column we shall subsitute the values. I shall look at various columns and their unique value count ,this helps me in knowing if vatibale is of categorical type ,how many categories are there. I can fimd data tupe of coulmn using info method. In this datset we have 12 coulmns and out of these 12 , 11 are of type object and one column of type int. To know more about this numerical column Ihave ised describe ethod that helps me to know maximum,minimum value count and mean and other parameters too

Now I shall be using graphs for visual representation and perform EDA using uni-variate,bi-varites..I shall finding be finding follwing information using graphs

Type of content
TOP 15 Netflix using countries
Count of content realeased per year
Different genre and their count
Different kind of rating and their count
Distribution of movies/shows according to months
Distribution according to date
Relationship between type of content and rating
TOP 10 countries and their preference of content type
Top 10 Genre of Movies
Top 10 genre of Shows
Top 15 actors on Netflix
Distribution of duration of movies
Most appeared words in title of Netflix content(WORDCLOUD)
Since cleaning is done EDA is done and we drawn conclusion about certain columns, it is time to pre process our data . I started by pre processing text by

removing punctuation
removing stopwords
stemming
tokenization
Once through with this process it is time to implement our model. I shall be creating two variables for storing length of text in description column and listed_in columnn and then rescaling it.Also we have done PCA(princpal compnent analysis)

Once done we shall impement our model and find out best value of k,I shall be using followinf methods

Elbow Method
Hierarchical Clustering
Agglomerative hierarchical Clustering
After this we shall conclude our project and write some insights

**Conclusions:**

In this project, we worked on a text clustering problem wherein we had to group the Netflix shows into certain clusters such that the shows within a cluster are similar to each other and the shows in different clusters are dissimilar to each other.

The dataset contained about 7787 records, and 12 attributes.

We began by dealing with the dataset's missing values and doing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

We had performed lots of operations over the dataset to find out some very useful information from it. Netflix has more Movies than TV shows.

Also, majority of the shows were produced in the United States, and the majority of the shows on Netflix were created for adults and young adults age group.

Most of the number of Movies and TV shows produced by United States followed by India.

Most of the Content on Netflix (Movies and TV shows combined) is highest in year 2018

Majority of the movies range in length from 90 to 120 minutes and the majority of TV shows have only one season.

Dramas, International movies are the most popular Genres on Netflix.

Most of title have words like christmas,love,girl common.

When it comes to movie documentaries is most like genre and in case of shows kid's Tv

It was decided to cluster the data based on the attributes: director, cast, country, genre, and description. The values in these attributes were tokenized, preprocessed, and then vectorized using TFIDF vectorizer.
Through TFIDF Vectorization, we created a total of 20000 attributes.

We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to handle the curse of dimensionality. 4000 components were able to capture more than 80% of variance, and hence, the number of components were restricted to 4000.

We first built clusters using the k-means clustering algorithm, and the optimal number of clusters came out to be 6. This was obtained through the elbow method and Silhouette score analysis.

Then clusters were built using the Agglomerative clustering algorithm, and the optimal number of clusters came out to be 12. This was obtained after visualizing the dendrogram.

A content based recommender system was built using the similarity matrix obtained after using cosine similarity. This recommender system will show 10 recommendation We had performed lots of operations over the dataset to find out some very useful information from it. Netflix has more Movies than TV shows.
